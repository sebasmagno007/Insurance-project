# U.S. Medical Insurance Project

This project was developed using a dataset containing basic insurance information from 1,338 people. The dataset is a CSV file publicly available and was obtained through the Codecademy platform.

The project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, which explains how the questions are resolved and presents conclusions, including the code used to analyze the dataset.

The structure of the project was defined using the scoping guide from The Data Science and Public Policy Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. Consequently, the repository also contains an Excel document that includes a modification of the "Data Maturity Framework" designed by this organization.

The steps followed to perform this analysis are as follows:

1. **Step 0: Problem Understanding ** - Understand and identify the main variables affecting insurance costs and how insurance costs vary by sex and geographic distribution.

2. **Step 1: Goals** - Describe the data provided and make it easy to modify and study.

3. **Step 2: Actions** - Describe and provide simple answers to variables affecting insurance costs.

4. **Step 3: Data** - The data includes information about nearly 1,400 people in the U.S. insurance system, available in a public CSV file. External data will not be added at this time.

5. **Step 4: Analysis** - Perform descriptive analysis, validated by providing the method, code, and cleaned data used.

## Ethical Considerations

- No identification numbers or names are visible.

- The dataset is entirely public and real. It includes data such as BMI, sex, age, and geographic location (not specific) that could be considered sensitive, but this analysis is not intended to cause any harm. The scope of this analysis is to understand influential variables.

- The data is publicly accessible, and the methods used in this project are available for anyone to review. The project is not intended to cause any harm, and any future use of this project is not my responsibility.
